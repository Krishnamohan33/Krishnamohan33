## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science Engineering student** who enjoys building complete products—from idea to deployment.

I don’t claim to be an expert in everything.  
What I do have is **consistency**: I learn, build, break things, fix them, and repeat.

### My core focus areas:
- **Java** – fundamentals, backend logic, and problem solving  
- **Web Development** – React, Next.js, modern frontend workflows  
- **Game Development** – Unity (C#), gameplay systems, mechanics, and small-scope games  

I work daily on improving my skills through:
- Personal projects  
- Indie games  
- Web apps  
- Open-source contributions
